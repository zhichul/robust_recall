      "Richard Rawlinson FRS (3 January 1690 – 6 April 1755) was an English clergyman and antiquarian collector of books and manuscripts, which he bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\n",
      "Life.\n",
      "Richard Rawlinson was a younger son of Sir Thomas Rawlinson (1647–1708), Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1705–6, and a brother of Thomas Rawlinson (1681–1725), the bibliophile who ruined himself in the South Sea Company, at whose sale in 1734 Richard bought many of the Orientalia. He was educated at St Paul's School, at Eton College, and at St John's College, Oxford. In 1714, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, where he was inducted by Newton. Rawlinson was a Jacobite and maintained a strong support for the exiled Stuart Royal family throughout his life. In 1716 was ordained as a Deacon and then priest in the nonjuring Church of England (see Nonjuring schism), the ceremony being performed by the non-juring Usager bishop, Jeremy Collier. Rawlinson was, in 1728, consecrated as a Bishop in the nonjuring church by Bishops Gandy, Blackbourne and Doughty. On Blackbourne's death in 1741 he became the senior nonjuring Bishop in London, and still maintained a congregation into the mid 1740s. He was particularly concerned with collecting the history and archives of the nonjurors, but later squabbled with his fellow bishops in continuing the succession with the consecration of Robert Gordon. \n",
      "Rawlinson travelled in England and on the continent of Europe, where he passed several years, making very diverse collections of books, manuscripts, pictures and curiosities of manuscripts, coins and curiosities, his books alone forming three libraries, English, foreign and Classical. \n",
      "Rawlinson was a friend of the antiquarian Thomas Hearne and, among his voluminous writings, published a \"Life\" of the antiquary Anthony Wood.\n",
      "Towards the end of his life, Rawlinson quarrelled with both the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. Cutting the Society of Antiquaries from his bequests, he began transferring his collections to the Bodleian. Among his collection was a copperplate known as the Bodleian Plate depicting structures in Williamsburg, Virginia. A series of almanacs in 175 volumes, ranging in date from 1607 to 1747 arrived in 1752–55. At his death, Rawlinson left to the Library 5,205 manuscripts bound in volumes that include many rare broadsides and other printed ephemera, his curiosities, and some other property that endowed a professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. The Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon was first appointed in 1795. He was also a benefactor to St John's College, Oxford.\n",
      "He died at Islington, London.\n",
      "Richard Rawlinson is buried at St John's College, Oxford, allegedly holding the skull of Christopher Layer, an executed Jacobite.\n",

      "Relationship with Theo.\n",
      "In December 1879, after finishing a course at the Amsterdam Trade School, Bonger traveled to Paris to work at Geo Wehry, a commodity trading firm that focused on tobacco, coffee, tea, and rubber. In 1881, he became librarian at the Hollandsche Club, an expatriate club in Paris, where he became friends with Theo van Gogh. He later introduced his sister Jo to Theo; they married in Amsterdam in 1889, but he and his wife did not attend the wedding because he thought the wedding cost too much and they could not afford to travel.\n",
      "Through Theo, he knew Vincent van Gogh, who called him \"André\" in letters. In a letter that Bonger wrote to his parents on March 31, 1885, he describes Theo van Gogh as having received unexpected news the prior week that his father had died due to a \"stroke of apoplexy\" after having received a letter the previous day that he was in perfect health. He mentioned that Van Gogh was not very strong, and so this was a very melancholy circumstance. In several letters over the remainder of the year, Bonger comments on a growing appreciation for and friendship with Theo. In 1886, Vincent van Gogh arrived in Paris, which meant that Bonger saw less of Theo. Bonger expressed his concern that Vincent's harshness towards Theo, who had begun to look haggard. Theo met Bonger's parents during a visit to the Netherlands in 1886. \n",
      "Theo had hoped to open a gallery of his own, with his brother-in-law Andries as a partner. Despite promising talks, it never came to fruition.\n",
      "Theo died six months after his older brother Vincent's death, leaving Andries's sister Jo holding the letters of Vincent to Theo and in control of Vincent's artwork. Andries believed that his younger sister should not have sole say about what became of these remnants of her marriage and attempted to exert his influence over her. She resisted and the close of the siblings were at odds. Andries managed the sales of some of Vincent's artwork whose sale Jo authorized.\n",
      "Later life.\n",
      "In 1892, he returned to the Netherlands after taking a job with an insurance company based in Hilversum. Around this time, Bonger started collecting art, especially works by Odilon Redon and Émile Bernard, who were his friends. He also owned works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. He is buried at Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam.\n",

      "Kitty Pryde and Wolverine is a six-issue comic book limited series written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Al Milgrom, and published by Marvel Comics between November 1984 and April 1985.\n",
      "A spin-off of the series \"Uncanny X-Men\", it chronicles a Japanese adventure of two of the most popular X-Men of the time, Kitty Pryde and Wolverine.\n",
      "Publication history.\n",
      "In the introductory pages of the hardcover edition of \"Kitty Pryde and Wolverine\" (published 2008), Milgrom explains that the mini-series was powered by three main ideas. Firstly, Wolverine was the \"hottest property around\" that the X-Men franchise had, so stories with him would sell well. Secondly, Kitty Pryde was \"Chris' [Claremont] baby\", and Claremont was eager to develop this character further. Thirdly, Milgrom himself saw this as a unique chance to work with Marvel Comics legend Claremont.\n",
      "Claremont then wrote a story in which he could bring in new angles on the two characters. Kitty Pryde — previously little more than a sweet and innocent \"kid sister\" for the older X-Men, a literary foil to provide light-hearted moments — was portrayed as troubled with \"teenager self-doubt and self-deprecation\", \"searching for her very soul\" and going through the coming of age. Wolverine was put into the honor-driven, mystical Japanese culture, in which he was no longer the X-Men's campy hardman but \"grim and gritty\".\n",
      "To express the atypically dark and personal story, Milgrom also adapted his drawing style, using bolder, darker and more dynamic strokes. In the end, he was very satisfied with the project.\n",
      "In six issues, writer Chris Claremont takes Kitty Pryde fresh from her breakup with Colossus in \"Uncanny X-Men #183\" and puts her through a trial of fire in which she confronts her inner demons and emerges victorious. Claremont also plays off the contrast between Kitty and the battle-hardened Wolverine, and the two very different characters establish a platonic, brother-and-sister-like rapport (beginning a tradition of sorts for Wolverine and young female sidekicks). A testament to his newfound esteem for her character, Wolverine would even consider Kitty as a potential leader for the X-Men, were it not for her sheer youth, in later issues of the regular series.\n",
      "\"Kitty Pryde and Wolverine\" is also responsible for establishing Kitty's superhero image, finally settling on a costume which she would wear into the early 1990s, and choosing the codename \"Shadowcat\" (having previously flitted between \"Ariel\" and \"Sprite\"), which she took on after this adventure and has held on until today.\n",
      "Plot summary.\n",
      "Kitty Pryde's father Carmen has run into trouble with the Japanese Yakuza. In order to help him, Kitty follows him on a business trip but is captured by mob boss Shigematsu and the evil ninja Ogun, who brainwashes her into becoming a deadly ninja assassin. After she has perfected her skills, Ogun orders her to kill Wolverine, Ogun's former student, who has come to Japan to look for Kitty. \n",
      "A masked Kitty almost kills Wolverine, before she is knocked out by Logan's friend Yukio and comes to her senses. Terrified at having been turned into a killing machine, Kitty wants to flee, but Logan challenges her to overcome her conditioning by focusing on her inner strength. When Kitty, Yukio and Logan vanquish their opponents, Kitty has the chance to kill Ogun. But she balks, stating she cannot do it. For Wolverine, it is the proof that she is truly herself again. When Ogun tries to kill her, Wolverine impales him on his claws. Carmen Pryde exposes Shigematsu's schemes, turning himself in, and they return to the United States.\n",
      "Collected editions.\n",
      "The story was reprinted several times; once in \"Wolverine And Gambit\" (issues 62 to 68), then later in June 2008 (in premiere hardback form, ), in 2009's \"Wolverine Omnibus\" Volume 1, and also as part of the \"Marvel's Mightiest Heroes\" partworks series, in issue No. 117, simply titled \"Kitty Pryde\".\n",

The same year, he reached the finals of the juniors of Wimbledon Championships, losing to Ismail El Shafei. In 1965, though, he returned to the finals of the Wimbledon juniors, and this time won. In 1966, he became a two-time Wimbledon juniors champion and added to it the title of French juniors champion. In 1966 he also won his second Soviet championships in men's doubles (once again with Egorov).\n",

      "During the rest of his playing career, Korotkov repeatedly reached the finals of the Soviet championships in men's doubles (last time in 1979) and in mixed doubles (1970). His highest achievement at this level was winning the 1977 Soviet championships in singles where he defeated Vadim Borisov in the final. He also won several All-Union tennis tournaments of lesser rank. From 1966 to 1977, he was a part of the Soviet Top 10 list of players, reaching no. 3 in 1973.\n",
      "Korotkov successfully played in international amateur tournaments, winning a number of international tournaments played in the Soviet Union, including doubles event at the 1973 Summer Universiade. He was a part of the Soviet Union Davis Cup team between 1969 and 1974, winning 10 out of 21 rubbers. In 1974, he won the European Zone with the Soviet team but lost to the India Davis Cup team in the inter-zonal semifinals. After the start of the Open Era, Korotkov played in some open tournaments with limited success; his best results were the fourth round of the Italian Open in 1969 (defeating Charlie Pasarell and Owen Davidson on his way) and in 1973 (defeating Cliff Richey). He also reached the third round at the first Open Wimbledon Championships in 1968.\n",
      "Coaching career.\n",
      "After finishing active playing career, Korotkov became a coach. He worked at several sports clubs between 1981 and 1996, including Moscow Tennis Academy in 1993–1994.\n",

In 1638 John Clarke, a minister, from Great Britain, started leading worship in nearby Portsmouth, Rhode Island (Newport County) after he and his congregation were exiled from Massachusetts after disagreements with the Puritan leadership.\n",
      "By 1644 Clarke's group moved to Newport where the current church was founded and the first meeting house was constructed at Green's End within that same year, which was the first church building of any denomination in the colony. The congregation used the building until 1708 when the first meeting house in Newport was constructed on Tanner Street in Newport on the corner of Calendar Avenue, adjacent to the cemetery, which was established on land donated by Clarke. In addition to Clarke, Obadiah Holmes and John Crandall were active in the leadership of the church in the seventeenth century.\n",
      "In 1656, while Clarke was in England — advocating for the Colony's royal charter and religious liberty — a group of congregants broke off from the church to found the Second Baptist Church in Newport, which followed Six Principle Baptist (Arminian) principles in contrast to Clarke's more Calvinist theology. (Second Baptist would eventually reunite with First Baptist in 1946, hence its present name.)\n",
      "In December 1671, two members of the church — Samuel and Tacy Hubbard — withdrew and joined with Stephen Mumford, a Seventh Day Baptist (SDB) from England, and others. Their new congregation was the first SDB church in America.\n",
      "18th century.\n",
      "From 1731 to 1748 John Callendar, a prominent clergyman and author, served as pastor of the church. In 1737 Hezekiah Carpenter and Josiah Lyons donated the current land on Spring Street for a meeting house which was constructed that year. \n",

      "According to the United Baptist Church's website \"[i]n 1943, the Rev. Lester Revoir, who became the pastor of the nearby Second Baptist Church on Clarke Street, in 1942, added to his responsibilities by becoming the pastor of the First Baptist Church. Three years later, in 1946, the First and Second Baptist Churches merged to form “The United Baptist Church, John Clarke Memorial\", the present name of the church.\" The church steeple was replaced with a smaller version after the 1938 Hurricane.\n",

      "Grass: History of Marijuana is a 1999 Canadian documentary film directed by Ron Mann, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, about the history of the United States government's war on marijuana in the 20th century. The film was narrated by actor Woody Harrelson.\n",
      "Overview.\n",
      "The film follows the history of US federal policies and social attitudes towards marijuana, beginning at the turn of the twentieth century. The history presented is broken up into parts, approximately the length of a decade, each of which is introduced by paraphrasing the official attitude towards marijuana at the time (e.g. \"Marijuana will make you insane\" or \"Marijuana will make you addicted to heroin\"), and closed by providing a figure for the amount of money spent during that period on the \"war on marijuana.\"\n",
      "The film places much of the blame for marijuana criminalization on Harry Anslinger (the first American drug czar) who promoted false information about marijuana to the American public as a means towards abolition. It later shows how the federal approach to criminalization became more firmly entrenched after Richard Nixon declared a \"War on Drugs\" and created the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1973, and even more so a decade later and on, as First Lady Nancy Reagan introduced the \"Just Say No\" campaign and President George H. W. Bush accelerated the War on Drugs. The film ends during the Bill Clinton administration, which had accelerated spending even further on the War on Drugs.\n",
      "\"Grass\" is almost completely composed of archival footage, much of which is from public domain U.S. propaganda films and such feature films as \"Reefer Madness\", as it also served as a portrait of marijuana in popular media.\n",
      "The art director and poster designer of the film was Paul Mavrides.\n",
      "Critical reception.\n",
      "The film was generally well received by critics, scoring 64 out of 100 in Metacritic, and a rating of 75% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n",
      "The film won Canada's Genie Award for Best Documentary.\n",

      "Sugar is a 2004 independent Canadian romantic drama film co-written and directed by John Palmer, and starring Andre Noble, Brendan Fehr, Marnie McPhail, Maury Chaykin, and Sarah Polley. Its plot follows a young gay man who falls in love with street hustler in Toronto. It is based on short stories by Bruce LaBruce. Noble, who received strong reviews for his performance in \"Sugar\", died just a few weeks after the film's debut.\n",
      "Plot.\n",
      "In suburban Ontario, Cliff is a young gay man who lives with his mother, Madge, an unconventional woman who owns her own chocolate delivery company, and his savvy adolescent sister, Cookie. On his 18th birthday, Cookie encourages Cliff to take a trip into Toronto, celebrate, and lose his virginity. Cookie gives him a skateboard and a spliff. In the city, he encounters a gay ghetto where he meets Butch, a hustler in his 20s. Cliff is immediately infatuated with Butch and manages to strike a conversation with him. After a while, the two begin kissing passionately in an abandoned flat, but Butch stops the encounter and leaves, declining Cliff's suggestion that they get coffee together. Cliff follows him to an alley where Butch spends his time with a group of street kids and punks. Cliff manages to ingratiate himself with the group, and spends the evening with them at Paradise, a local club. Cliff is pursued by a young pregnant woman there, but he explains to her that he is not attracted to women.\n",
      "In the early morning, Cliff goes back with Butch to Butch's apartment, where they share a bed. Later, shortly after they wake up, Cliff expresses romantic interest in Butch, but Butch is evasive about becoming too invested in him. During breakfast, Butch tells Cliff he feels aroused, and the two engage in mutual masturbation. Butch and Cliff quickly grow close, and Cliff brings him to meet his mother and little sister. Butch and Cliff lie to Madge about the origins of their relationship, claiming to have met at Kmart, where Butch says he works as a shelf stocker. Madge takes a liking to Butch, but warns him not to hurt her son. After dinner, Cliff admits to her that Butch is in fact a hustler.\n",
      "Cliff and Butch's relationship progresses, and Cliff grows more comfortable with Butch's regular clients. Among them are Stanley, a middle-aged gay man who likes to engage in non-sexual sadomasochism. One day Butch suggests Cliff participate in a sexual transaction involving one of his clients. In order to muster courage, Cliff gets drunk, and he and Butch arrive at the apartment of the man, who says he only wants to vicariously observe the two men have sex. Butch has anal sex with Cliff for the first time in front of the man. The encounter leaves Cliff humiliated, and he shoves Butch to the ground as the two leave, telling him he never wants to see him again. Cliff becomes profoundly depressed.\n",
      "Sometime later, Cliff and Butch meet to talk, and Cliff finds that he has been abusing prescription medication and other drugs. Later, while alone, Butch goes to meet Cookie, who is eager to see him, outside her school. Shortly into the conversation, Butch asks if her if he could buy the Ritalin she is prescribed for her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but she tells him she does not have access to it, and that it is dispensed by the school nurse. Butch leaves, dejected. Later, Butch calls Cliff and asks him to meet him at Paradise. Cliff reluctantly agrees, and arrives to find Butch kissing an older man, Greg, whom he says he now lives with. Butch's behavior is erratic, and he appears to be experiencing a noticeable drug high. The two go to Greg's apartment alone, where Butch suggests the two flee to Hawaii and live together. Cliff leaves, unable to console him. Butch subsequently dies of an overdose.\n",
      "Cliff, Madge, and Cookie attend Butch's funeral. During the wake, Cliff hallucinates Butch sitting up in his casket, and reminiscing about how much fun the two had together. Later, Cliff and Cookie go to a diner, where Cliff catches the attention of a young man. Adopting a newfound confidence, Cliff proceeds to cruise him in the bathroom. Following the encounter, Cliff gives Cookie a hug before the two part separate ways. Cookie watches as Cliff throws his skateboard into the street-side garbage and walks away.\n",

It subsequently screened in San Francisco, California on June 24, 2004, before opening commercially in Canada on June 25. Approximately a month following the film's commercial release, star Andre Noble died of accidental poisoning after ingesting aconitum during a camping trip.\n",
      "Reception.\n",
      "Critical response.\n",
      "Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" praised the lead performances of Noble and Fehr, adding: \"\"Sugar\" sports the expected outre elements — sex, drugs, reckless self-destruction — but also has streaks of tenderness, pathos, and directorial skill...  Despite [the] tale’s harsh aspects and eventual tragic turn, \"Sugar\" maintains an almost whimsical tenor that reflects Cliff’s innocently accepting walk-on-the-wide-side perspective.\" Michael Wilde, writing for \"The Advocate\", praised the film's performances, writing: \"Both Fehr and Noble do excellent work [and] the supporting cast, including indie darling Sarah Polley, provides plenty of humor with their eccentric performances. As tasty as \"Sugar\" is, it tortures us exquisitely with the pains of first love and of losing someone to addiction.\"\n",
      "Peter Knegt of \"Exclaim!\" wrote: \"Cliff is obviously headed for trouble, but the film works hard to avoid becoming a cautionary tale. \"Sugar\" plays down the melodrama, in that AIDS is barely mentioned, the acceptance from Cliff's family is almost assumed and the excessive drug use is hardly condemned (though it's not glamorised either). And while at times it becomes unclear whether certain events are displayed merely for shock value (some scenes border on soft-core pornography), it is clear that Sugar does an exceptional job at humanising characters that rarely receive this treatment.\"\n",
      "Accolades.\n",
      "The film received two nominations at the 25th Genie Awards in 2005: Klinck, Laplante and Palmer were nominated in the Best Adapted Screenplay category, while Fehr was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.\n",
